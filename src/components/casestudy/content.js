Current methods to provide the porter services in Indian Railway stations are pathetic in terms of the ease to get a coolie, booking one and later paying for it without any hustles or feuds. This goes for the service providers or Coolies as well. Fluctuating wages based on a bargain model, fewer perks and negligible respect for the job drives the tension between a customer and a coolie. Having identified this, Enactus IIT Roorkee in its drive to empower the porters and help the customers have come up with an in depth analysis of the problem. However, they are stuck with a feasible solution to tackle this and require your teamâ€™s help to reach a conclusion.
